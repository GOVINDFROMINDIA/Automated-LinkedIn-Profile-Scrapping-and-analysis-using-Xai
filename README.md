# Combating Counterfeit Currency with Generative Adversarial Networks and Ensemble Methods
Counterfeit currency represents a grave menace to the financial stability of nations, capable of undermining public trust in the financial system and impeding economic growth. Conventional methods of counterfeit detection, often reliant on human experts scrutinizing banknotes, are plagued by time-consuming procedures and susceptibility to errors. In this innovative project, we propose a groundbreaking approach to counterfeit detection through the fusion of deep learning and ensemble methods. Our methodology commences with the training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using a comprehensive dataset encompassing both genuine and counterfeit currency notes. The GAN's role is pivotal, as it adeptly learns to generate counterfeit notes that bear an uncanny resemblance to their authentic counterparts. Subsequently, these artificially generated counterfeit notes serve as training data for three distinct deep learning models: ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG. Following the meticulous training of the models, an ensemble method is employed for the classification of new banknotes into either genuine or counterfeit categories. The ensemble approach amalgamates the predictive capabilities of the three models, resulting in a classification process that is notably more accurate and robust. In the event that a counterfeit note is identified, an instantaneous alert is dispatched to government authorities. This swift notification mechanism facilitates prompt action to remove the counterfeit notes from circulation, curbing potential financial ramifications. Our proposed approach offers a plethora of advantages compared to conventional counterfeit detection methods. The system boasts heightened accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Importantly, it possesses the capability to identify counterfeit notes that have not yet permeated the financial ecosystem.
